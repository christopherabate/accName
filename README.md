# accName
A simple accessible name finder

A simple function to a JavaScript bookmarklet that displays accessible information about HTML elements when hovering the mouse. The tooltip is fixed in position, draggable, and includes a close feature. It shows the element's name (tagName, ID, class) and accessible attributes (such as aria-label, alt, etc.), truncated to 120 characters if necessary. The script also prevents text selection during the tooltip's movement and excludes certain elements like div, html, and body.
